# Prisoner's Dilemma Recreation

This program is a recreaction of a classic concept in Game Theory called Prisoner's Dilemma. It's a short, text based game playable in any Java console (BlueJ recommended). 

This is a simple, text-based activity about choices and trust.
You play against an AI opponent over several short rounds.
Each round you choose to cooperate or to defect.
After both choices are made, you will see the outcome and points.

Game Theory:
The Prisoner's Dilemma is a classic example in game theory.
Two players choose, without talking, to cooperate or to defect.
If both cooperate, both do well. If both defect, both do only a little.
If one defects while the other cooperates, the defector does best.
Over repeated rounds, trust can raise the score for both players.

How to play:
You and the AI will play a random number of rounds (5 to 15).
On each round choose: [c] cooperate, or [d] defect.
Open help at any time with [g] game theory or [i] instructions.
View what has happened so far with [h] history.
To quit, press [q] and confirm when asked.
Aim for the best total by thinking about the long term.

DISCLAIMER:
This game is completely fictional, and any mentions of prison or the justice system are abstract and not intended to be representative of the world we live in.

Enjoy :)
